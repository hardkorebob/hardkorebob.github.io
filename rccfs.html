<h1>Building a Filesystem-Based C Code Generator in AWK: Because Why Not?</h1>
<h2>Or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Turn Code Into Directories</h2>

<p>I built a C code generator in AWK that treats functions as directories. Yes, you read that right. Before you close this tab thinking I've lost my mind, hear me out – there's method to this madness, and it might just change how you think about code organization.</p>

<h2>The Problem Nobody Talks About</h2>
<p>We've all been there. You open your editor to write some C code, and that cursor just blinks at you mockingly...</p>

<h2>Why AWK? (The Question Everyone Asks)</h2>
<p>"Why not Python?" "Why not Rust?" "Why not literally anything else?"</p>
<p>Because constraints breed creativity. AWK is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Already on your system (yes, even that ancient box in the corner)</li>
<li>Dead simple (the entire thing is ~600 lines)</li>
<li>Perfect for text manipulation (which is all code really is)</li>
<li>Part of the Plan 9 philosophy I'm embracing</li>
</ul>

<h2>The Unix Philosophy on Steroids</h2>
<p>Unix says "everything is a file." Plan 9 says "no, really, EVERYTHING is a file." So I thought: what if code structure was literally file structure?</p>

<h2>The Technical Magic</h2>
<pre>
else if (choice == "v") var()
else if (choice == "a") fun()  
else if (choice == "f") fol()
else if (choice == "W") whl()
</pre>

<pre>
function sendline(filepath, line) {
    print line >> filepath
    close(filepath)
}
</pre>

<h2>Real-World Usage Patterns</h2>
<h3>The Scratchpad Pattern</h3>
<p>You're debugging something and need a quick test...</p>

<h3>The Learning Pattern</h3>
<p>Someone asks "how do you write a linked list in C?"...</p>

<h3>The Exploration Pattern</h3>
<p>Inherited a codebase? Generate it through RCC...</p>

<h2>The Philosophical Bits</h2>
<h3>Simplicity as a Feature</h3>
<p>In a world where development environments require gigabytes...</p>

<h3>Transparency Over Magic</h3>
<p>Modern tools hide complexity behind magic...</p>

<h3>Composition Over Configuration</h3>
<p>Instead of building every possible feature...</p>

<h2>The Criticisms (And Why They're Features)</h2>
<p>"But it doesn't have syntax highlighting!"...</p>

<h2>What This Teaches Us</h2>
<ol>
<li><strong>Constraints are liberating</strong></li>
<li><strong>Interfaces matter</strong></li>
<li><strong>Simple beats clever</strong></li>
<li><strong>Teaching is design</strong></li>
</ol>

<h2>The Broader Implications</h2>
<p>What if we applied this thinking elsewhere?...</p>

<h2>Try It Yourself</h2>
<pre>
#!/bin/awk -f
BEGIN {
    while (1) {
        printf "> "
        getline cmd
        if (cmd == "func") {
            printf "Name: "; getline name
            system("mkdir -p funcs/" name)
            print "int " name "() {" > "funcs/" name "/sig.c"
        }
        else if (cmd == "quit") break
    }
}
</pre>

<h2>The Future</h2>
<p>RCC is intentionally unfinished...</p>

<h2>Conclusion: Building Joy</h2>
<p>In an industry obsessed with the new and complex...</p>

<p><em>P.S. – If you build something weird with this approach, I want to hear about it. The world needs more joyful tools.</em></p>
