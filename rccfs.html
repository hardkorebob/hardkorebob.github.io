<h1>Building a Filesystem-Based C Code Generator in AWK: Because Why Not?</h1>

<h2>Or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Turn Code Into Directories</h2>

<p>I built a C code generator in AWK that treats functions as directories. Yes, you read that right. Before you close this tab thinking I've lost my mind, hear me out – there's method to this madness, and it might just change how you think about code organization.</p>

<h2>The Problem Nobody Talks About</h2>

<p>We've all been there. You open your editor to write some C code, and that cursor just blinks at you mockingly. Where do you start? Headers? Main function? That helper function you know you'll need? The blank page problem isn't about not knowing C – it's about the cognitive load of keeping track of syntax while you're trying to solve actual problems.</p>

<p>Traditional solutions throw more complexity at this: IDEs with autocomplete, snippets, templates, AI assistants. But what if we went the other direction? What if we made it so simple it's almost stupid?</p>

<p>Enter RCC (I'll let you decide what it stands for – Really Cool Compiler? Ridiculously Convoluted Creator?). It's an interactive AWK script that generates C code through a conversational interface. But here's where it gets interesting: every function becomes a directory, every variable gets filed away, and your entire program becomes navigable through the filesystem.</p>

<h2>Why AWK? (The Question Everyone Asks)</h2>

<p>"Why not Python?" "Why not Rust?" "Why not literally anything else?"</p>

<p>Because constraints breed creativity. AWK is:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Already on your system (yes, even that ancient box in the corner)</li>
  <li>Dead simple (the entire thing is ~600 lines)</li>
  <li>Perfect for text manipulation (which is all code really is)</li>
  <li>Part of the Plan 9 philosophy I'm embracing</li>
</ul>

<p>But the real reason? AWK forces you to think differently. You can't just import a library for everything. You have to actually solve problems, and sometimes those solutions are more elegant than what you'd get with a "real" language.</p>

<h2>The Unix Philosophy on Steroids</h2>

<p>Unix says "everything is a file." Plan 9 says "no, really, EVERYTHING is a file." So I thought: what if code structure was literally file structure?</p>

<p>Here's what happens when you create a function in RCC:</p>

<pre><code>⊹╰(⌣ʟ⌣)╯⊹ Σ a
λ Function name: process_data
λ Return type: int
λ Arguments: char *buffer, size_t len
</code></pre>

<p>Behind the scenes:</p>

<pre><code>rcc_project/
└── functions/
    └── process_data/
        ├── signature.c    # int process_data(char *buffer, size_t len) {
        ├── vars.c         # local variables go here
        └── body.c         # actual function logic
</code></pre>

<p>Now you can:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>cat rcc_project/functions/process_data/vars.c</code> to see local variables</li>
  <li><code>grep -r "malloc" rcc_project/functions/</code> to find memory allocations</li>
  <li><code>ls rcc_project/functions/</code> to see all your functions</li>
  <li>Use any Unix tool to analyze your code structure</li>
</ul>

<p>This isn't just a gimmick. It fundamentally changes how you interact with code.</p>

<h2>The Interface: ASCII Art and Personality</h2>

<pre><code>████████████▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒

⊹╰(⌣ʟ⌣)╯⊹ Σ ?

o()xxxx[{::::::::::::::::::>
</code></pre>

<p>Yes, there's ASCII art. Yes, there are emoticons. No, I'm not apologizing.</p>

<p>Here's why: Programming is a human activity. We get frustrated, we celebrate small victories, we bang our heads against walls. Traditional tools pretend this emotional component doesn't exist. RCC embraces it.</p>

<p>When you make an error:</p>

<pre><code>λ ┌П┐ »»»»»»─=≡ΣO)) [¬º-°]¬ ✧
</code></pre>

<p>Is that someone flipping a table? A wizard spell gone wrong? It doesn't matter – it made you smile, and that smile is a cognitive reset. That's UX design.</p>

<h2>The Technical Magic</h2>

<p>The core is beautifully simple. Each command maps to a function:</p>

<pre><code>else if (choice == "v") var()      # Create variable
else if (choice == "a") fun()      # Add function  
else if (choice == "f") fol()      # For loop
else if (choice == "W") whl()      # While loop
</code></pre>

<p>But here's where it gets clever. The <code>sendline()</code> function maintains parallel representations:</p>

<pre><code>function sendline(filepath, line) {
    print line >> filepath
    close(filepath)
}
</code></pre>

<p>Everything goes to both:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The in-memory buffer (for immediate viewing/editing)</li>
  <li>The appropriate file in the directory structure</li>
</ol>

<p>This dual representation means you can work either way – interactively through RCC or directly on files with your favorite editor.</p>

<h2>Context-Aware Code Generation</h2>

<p>RCC knows where you are:</p>

<pre><code>⊹╰(⌣ʟ⌣)╯⊹ [process_data] Σ v
λ Variable type: int
λ Variable name: count
λ Initial value: 0
</code></pre>

<p>That <code>[process_data]</code> tells you you're inside a function. Variables created here go to <code>functions/process_data/vars.c</code>. Create a variable at the top level? It goes to <code>globals/vars.c</code>.</p>

<p>This context awareness extends everywhere:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Function calls inside functions → <code>body.c</code></li>
  <li>Structs at top level → <code>globals/structs.c</code></li>
  <li>Prototypes → <code>includes/prototypes.h</code></li>
</ul>

<p>The filesystem becomes a living representation of your program's structure.</p>

<h2>Real-World Usage Patterns</h2>

<h3>The Scratchpad Pattern</h3>

<p>You're debugging something and need a quick test. Instead of creating <code>test.c</code>, <code>test2.c</code>, <code>test_final.c</code>, <code>test_final_REAL.c</code>:</p>

<pre><code>$ awk -f rcc.awk
⊹╰(⌣ʟ⌣)╯⊹ Σ i
λ Header: stdio
⊹╰(⌣ʟ⌣)╯⊹ Σ a
λ Function name: test_theory
</code></pre>

<p>Build your test, run it, and if it's worth keeping, the structure is already there. If not, just <code>rm -rf rcc_project</code>.</p>

<h3>The Learning Pattern</h3>

<p>Someone asks "how do you write a linked list in C?" Instead of pointing to documentation:</p>

<pre><code>⊹╰(⌣ʟ⌣)╯⊹ Σ ;
λ Struct name: node
λ Field type: int
λ Field name: data
λ Field type: struct node*
λ Field name: next
</code></pre>

<p>They see the structure being built interactively. They understand not just the syntax but the thought process.</p>

<h3>The Exploration Pattern</h3>

<p>Inherited a codebase? Generate it through RCC, and now you can:</p>

<pre><code># Find all functions that use malloc
$ grep -l "malloc" rcc_project/functions/*/body.c

# See all global variables
$ cat rcc_project/globals/vars.c

# Find complex functions
$ wc -l rcc_project/functions/*/body.c | sort -n
</code></pre>

<p>The filesystem becomes a queryable database of your code structure.</p>

<h2>The Philosophical Bits</h2>

<h3>Simplicity as a Feature</h3>

<p>In a world where development environments require gigabytes of disk space and eat RAM for breakfast, RCC is ~20KB of AWK. It runs on a potato. It probably runs on your router.</p>

<p>This isn't poverty – it's freedom. No npm install, no dependency hell, no version conflicts. Just copy the script and go.</p>

<h3>Transparency Over Magic</h3>

<p>Modern tools hide complexity behind magic. RCC shows you exactly what it's doing. Every line of C it generates is visible, every file it creates is inspectable. You learn by seeing, not by trusting.</p>

<h3>Composition Over Configuration</h3>

<p>Instead of building every possible feature, RCC provides primitives that compose. Want to analyze your code? Use grep. Want to transform it? Use sed. Want to visualize it? Pipe it through graphviz.</p>

<p>This is the Unix way: small tools that do one thing well, working together.</p>

<h2>The Criticisms (And Why They're Features)</h2>

<ul>
  <li>"But it doesn't have syntax highlighting!"<br>– Use your editor on the generated files</li>
  <li>"But it doesn't have autocomplete!"<br>– You learn the syntax by typing it</li>
  <li>"But it's not integrated with my workflow!"<br>– It outputs text files. That's the ultimate integration.</li>
  <li>"But AWK is ancient!"<br>– So is C. So is Unix. Good ideas are timeless.</li>
</ul>

<h2>What This Teaches Us</h2>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Constraints are liberating</strong>: Can't do something the "normal" way? Find a better way.</li>
  <li><strong>Interfaces matter</strong>: A tool with personality gets used. A tool that's just functional gets forgotten.</li>
  <li><strong>Simple beats clever</strong>: The filesystem approach is obvious in hindsight. That's what makes it good.</li>
  <li><strong>Teaching is design</strong>: If your tool naturally teaches people how to use it, you've designed it right.</li>
</ol>

<h2>The Broader Implications</h2>

<p>What if we applied this thinking elsewhere?</p>

<ul>
  <li>SQL query builders that create directory structures of joins</li>
  <li>HTML generators where tags are folders</li>
  <li>Configuration management where settings are files in a tree</li>
</ul>

<p>The filesystem is an underutilized interface. We've been trained to think of it as "primitive" compared to databases or object stores. But sometimes primitive is powerful.</p>

<h2>Try It Yourself</h2>

<p>Here's a minimal version to get you started:</p>

<pre><code>#!/bin/awk -f
BEGIN {
    while (1) {
        printf "&gt; "
        getline cmd
        if (cmd == "func") {
            printf "Name: "; getline name
            system("mkdir -p funcs/" name)
            print "int " name "() {" > "funcs/" name "/sig.c"
        }
        else if (cmd == "quit") break
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>That's it. That's a filesystem-based code generator. Build from there.</p>

<h2>The Future</h2>

<p>RCC is intentionally unfinished. It's not a product – it's a philosophy. Fork it, break it, rebuild it. Make it yours.</p>

<p>Some ideas:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Git integration (each function could be a submodule)</li>
  <li>Parallel implementations for other languages</li>
  <li>Visual filesystem navigators specifically for code</li>
  <li>Integration with Plan 9's plumber</li>
</ul>

<p>But honestly? It might be perfect just as it is. Sometimes done is better than perfect, and simple is better than complete.</p>

<h2>Conclusion: Building Joy</h2>

<p>In an industry obsessed with the new and complex, there's something refreshing about building a tool in AWK that uses the filesystem as a database and emoticons as error messages. It's not trying to change the world – it's just trying to make writing C a little more fun.</p>

<p>And maybe that's enough. Maybe we need more tools built by people who aren't programmers, for people who aren't programmers. Maybe we need more ASCII art in our development workflows. Maybe, just maybe, we need to remember that code is for humans, not machines.</p>

<p>So go ahead, judge my AWK script with its weird emoticons and filesystem abuse. But while you're judging, I'll be building things and having fun doing it.</p>

<p>After all, isn't that why we started programming in the first place?</p>
