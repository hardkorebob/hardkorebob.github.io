	<h3>Purpose of Life</h3>
    <p>We live day to day during the same struggles of
    birth, old age, disease and death in which everyone
    in the parallel universes suffers. The universe is full
    of different lifeforms with unique material combinations beyond our
    current physical abilities to understand but we may achieve
    awereness via consciouness and by looking at the instructions left behind.
    The instructions are in the Bhagavad-gita(1972-Prabhupada).
    This source code comes directly verifiable from God Himself.
    The Age of Spiritual Science is here. The Puranas in the Vedas are the
    original history of our plane. This is the Holy Grail. It has all the info
    on everything and lacks nothing. All proven by "modern" science.
    There is now a clear understanding of our true, original origins.
    The instructions tell us that our purpose is to go back home, back to Godhead.
    </p>
<h3>Why should we care</h3>
    <p>To be conscious is the main sign of being a spiritual entity. 
    No entity is divided from its source at any time. 
    So is the purpose of life to survive it or to reach a position in 
    understanding that results in peace with bliss and true identity?
    We have an eternal life and we have the choice to move into eternity,
    to choose otherwise would be a loss and great pain. In order
    to appreciate such sublime thinking is to actually be in service
    of the Supreme Person. Our best interest is at hand, to solve
    the issue of repeated birth and death. To stop being in a miserable
    concept of reality. The entire current situation is that we come from
    nothing and go to nothing. A bleak and dark, and boring, ontological view.
    Reality is much more complex, beautiful and full than this impersonal vodism.
    Plus there is no need for guesswork or theory. The compiled program is
    already in full effect.
</p>
<h3>Service is Linking</h3>
    <p>To simply connect(serve)[bhakti] and be with the Happiest Person Krsna,
    <p>Chant...
    hare krsna
    hare krsna
    krsna krsna
    hare hare
    hare rama
    hare rama
    rama rama
    hare hare
    </p>
	<p>    ...and Be with Happy! We associate with the Original Source by
    calling out His names. What a simple and delightful process. 
    The intrigue is no belief is required to experience the non-phenomenon. ;)</p>

<p>When I think of writing I raise my nose
toward it because I feel my imagination
is better. This is not something I will
continue to indulge in. To make anything begin by
doing the thing step by step. In time
the pieces come together.</p>

<p>I expect to achieve something at the
end of reading anything. The something
can be an emotion, an understanding or
solve a problem. Rare are the times
I read for the pleasure of it,
as an activity in itself. </p>

<p>It helps with my anxiety to be
quiet honest to think this way.
Your time is quite valuable
because we never get it back.
Making the best of time is
important. Thank you for 
reading and supporting my
newfound hobby.</p>

<p></p>I must take a break as I feel the
stomach and aches of the body.</p>
